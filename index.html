</div>
		<div>PITTSBURGH POST-GAZETTE</div>
		<div>I am a designer currently working as an infographics specialist at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, where I create informative graphics that accompany stories published in digital and print formats. I also create interactive experiences to give readers an alternative way of engaging with content (aka keeping it fresh).
I graduated in December 2020 with a Master of Arts in Interactive Information Design. You can check out my Masters project here. 

When I’m not working on graphics and masters projects, you’ll probably catch me listening to a podcast as I plan my next project, while watching a movie, reading a book and gaming with some old pals — all at the same time of course.

Below are selected works, most of which are from my time as a designer in 2015 and 2016.
</div>

		<div>The Post is a student-run newspaper covering Ohio University and Athens County. As Design Editor I co-led a major redesign of the paper's print and web publications.

</div>
		<div>Early concept of Part 1 of "The Death Ship.” I scratched this initial prototype in favor of a more rigid layout to simplify the inherently complicated presentation.</div>
		<div>Screen recording of animation in Part I being controlled by scrolling.</div>
		<div>Design and development</div>
		<div>As the story continued to form, the main challenge of the project became clear:

How could I present both the diary and contextual annotations simultaneously as a cohesive story?

The solution? Scrollytelling.
</div>
		<div>Life behind “The Death Ship”</div>
		<div>... and the various “fade to blacks” in Part III.
</div>
		<div>A couple of my early sketches. One of them is used in the final project. (An easter egg of sorts.)

</div>
		<div>Screen recording of fades and animations in Part III being controlled by scrolling.</div>
		<div>Decluttering the story</div>
		<div>What’s next for the project?</div>
		<div>Parts from the original paper that sparked the idea for the project:</div>
		<div>Scrollytelling made it possible for me to do more cinematic reveals like the ship at sea in Part I...
</div>
		<div>Scrollytelling enabled me to present each diary entry, freeze it in place, and have annotations reveal themselves as the user scrolled.

Figuring out the flow and spacing of the annotations took plenty of trial and error.

Initially, I had planned for more variety in how the entries could be presented. 
</div>
		<div>I taped two pieces of cardboard together to form an giant timeline, where I plotted the most crucial details from the diary as I read. This exercise further familarized me with the story, and actually enabled me to to see a physical representation of the plot, with the most eventful peaks at the time of the outbreak.</div>
		<div>The outbreak was so disasterous that the New Zealand troopship on which it occurred became known as the “Death Ship.” I was hooked on the story right from the start, and set out to learn everything I could about it.</div>
		<div>Process</div>
		<div>I highlighted anything in the transcription I thought stood out and recorded copious amounts of notes, questions I had and things to consider.</div>
		<div>This project was born out of intense curiousity, fueled by the events of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and brought to light by the generosity of several New Zealanders.</div>
		<div>Ultimately, I went with “The Death Ship.” 

</div>
		<div>Early exploration</div>
		<div>But after several prototypes, I realized that it was better to have a concrete layout that all entries adhered to. The content, design and animations would be enough to keep the reader occupied.

This project was an exercise in treading the line between overloading the reader with information, and presenting them with just enough.
</div>

</div>
		<div>One of the many challenges of this project was filtering 90+ days worth of diary entries into an approachable narrative. I found it helpful to visualize my selected entries in a story map, which I continued to cut and revise as I developed the story. </div>
		<div>This journey isn’t over just yet. I have plans to get this project published, possibly in collaboration with a New Zealand museum or other historical organization. Stay tuned!
</div>
		<div>I contacted the article’s author, who then connected me with the diarist’s grandson, who kindly provided me with a transcription of the diary to use with my project. As I read and reread the transcription, the earliest forms of the story began to take shape.</div>
		<div>This project originated from an academic paper I read back in March 2020, three weeks into the COVID-19 quarantine in Pittsburgh, PA. The paper discusses a New Zealand soldier’s diary and the unprecedented perspective it gives one of the worst outbreaks onboard a troopship during the 1918 pandemic. </div>

		<div>An early title for the project was “A sea like glass,” which is how the soldier described the ocean at the height of the outbreak.

		<div>This project was born out of intense curiosity, fueled by the events of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and brought to light by the generosity of several New Zealanders.</div>
		<div>MASTERS PROJECT</div>
		<div>In addition to the project originally being five parts, I had planned to include multiple illustrations per chapter. I learned very early into development just how much I would need to cut back on my plans. But the outline was a great place to start, and helped to organize my thoughts.</div>
		<div>With the help of developer Sam Underwood, a scrollytelling script was devised for specific use in Tumult Hype, the program the bulk of the project was subsequently developed in.</div>
		<div>Final version of Part 1 of "The Death Ship.” The layout for each entry is consistent throughout the project, in contrast to my earlier concepts.</div>
